# B2bLIB
To facilitate user research and application of the PPP-B2b service, a C/C++ decoding package named B2bLIB has been developed. This package is designed to seamlessly integrate with the widely used GNSS software RTKLIB. The B2bLIB is structured into two main components: message decoding and message processing.
